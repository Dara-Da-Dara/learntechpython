# Introduction to AI Agents

## What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a software entity that can **perceive its environment, reason about goals, make decisions, and take actions** to achieve specific objectives—often with minimal human intervention.

Unlike traditional AI models that simply generate outputs for a given input, **AI agents are autonomous, goal-driven, and adaptive systems**.

---

## From Models to Agents

Traditional AI systems:
- Respond to a single prompt
- Do not remember past interactions
- Do not decide what to do next

AI Agents:
- Operate across multiple steps
- Maintain context and state
- Decide actions dynamically
- Can use tools, memory, and external knowledge

> **Key shift:**  
> From *“answering questions”* → *“achieving goals”*

## Core Characteristics of AI Agents

### 1. Autonomy
Agents operate independently once given a goal.
They decide **how** to reach that goal without constant user input.

---

### 2. Perception
Agents can observe inputs from:
- Users
- Systems
- APIs
- Databases
- Sensors (in robotics)

This information forms the **initial state**.

---

### 3. Reasoning and Decision-Making
Agents analyze the current state and decide:
- What action to take
- Which tool to use
- Whether more information is needed

This reasoning can be:
- Rule-based
- LLM-based
- Hybrid

---

### 4. Action
Agents can act on the environment by:
- Calling APIs
- Executing code
- Querying databases
- Triggering workflows
- Communicating with other agents

---

### 5. Memory
Agents can store and retrieve information such as:
- Conversation history
- User preferences
- Past decisions
- Learned patterns

Memory enables **continuity and personalization**.

---

### 6. Goal-Oriented Behavior
Every agent operates with:
- A clear objective
- Constraints and rules
- Success or failure conditions

Agents continuously evaluate:
> “Am I closer to my goal?”

## Agentic AI vs Traditional AI

| Aspect | Traditional AI | Agentic AI |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| Interaction | Single-step | Multi-step |
| Decision Flow | Static | Dynamic |
| Memory | None or limited | Explicit memory |
| Tool Usage | Manual | Autonomous |
| Error Handling | None | Self-correction |
| Adaptability | Low | High |

## Key Components of an AI Agent

An AI agent system is typically composed of:

- **Agent (Reasoning Unit)**
- **Tools (Actions)**
- **Memory (Persistence)**
- **Knowledge Sources (RAG)**
- **Validation & Guardrails**
- **Orchestration Logic**

These components work together to form **intelligent behavior**.

---

## Simple Example

**Goal:** Determine course eligibility for a student

1. Agent receives user query
2. Retrieves rules from handbook (RAG)
3. Checks attendance via tool
4. Validates eligibility rules
5. Responds with decision
6. Stores interaction in memory

This is an **agent**, not just a chatbot.

## Why AI Agents Matter

AI agents enable:
- Intelligent automation
- Decision support systems
- Personalized assistants
- Enterprise workflows
- Multi-agent collaboration

They are foundational to:
- Autonomous systems
- Digital workers
- AI-first platforms

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- Customer support agents
- Research assistants
- Code generation agents
- Data analysis agents
- Scheduling and planning agents
- Compliance and policy agents

---

## One-Line Summary

**An AI agent is an autonomous, goal-driven system that perceives, reasons, acts, and learns through interaction with its environment.**

## What Comes Next

After understanding AI agents, the next concepts are:
- Nodes, edges, and state
- Orchestration strategies
- Memory and planning
- Self-correction and validation
- Multi-agent systems
