# What Is Initial Value? (Ultra-Simple Explanation)

---

## Simple Definition

**Initial value is the number we start with before we know anything.**

That's it. No jargon. Just the starting guess.

---

## Think Like This 👇

### 🎒 First Day of School Example

- You meet a teacher for the first time
- You don't know if they are good or bad
- You **assume something**

**That assumption is the initial value.**

## Initial Value in Reinforcement Learning

The agent must choose an action.  
It has **zero experience**.  
So we give each action a **starting number**.

**Example:**
Action A → value = 0
Action B → value = 0
Action C → value = 0


These starting numbers are called **initial values**.

---

## Why Do We Need It?

Because:  
**You cannot update something if you don't start from something.**  

No start → no learning.

---

## Very Tiny Example 🎰

3 slot machines.  
Never played before.  
You say:  

**"All machines are worth 0 for now."**

That **"0"** is the initial value.

---

## Important Point (One Line)

**Initial value = starting guess before learning.**

---

## Is Initial Value Fixed?

❌ **No.**  
- It changes after each reward  
- It improves with experience

---

## What Initial Value Is NOT ❌

- ❌ A reward  
- ❌ Final learned value  
- ❌ Guaranteed outcome
