# Tools and Frameworks for Memory Management in Self-Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Introduction

Memory management is a core component of modern learning systems. In **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)**, memory supports representation learning from unlabeled data, while in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, memory enables learning from interaction, delayed rewards, and experience reuse. This document outlines the **major tools, libraries, and frameworks** used for memory management in both paradigms.

## 5. Comparison of SSL and RL Memory Tools

| Aspect | SSL Tools | RL Tools |
|----|----|----|
| Memory focus | Representation | Experience |
| Storage type | Embeddings, samples | Transitions, episodes |
| Update signal | Prediction loss | Reward / TD-error |
| Popular frameworks | MoCo, BYOL, JEPA | SB3, RLlib, Dreamer |
| External memory | Vector DBs | Replay + Vector DBs |

---

## 6. Emerging Trends

- Unified memory for SSL + RL agents
- Vector databases as long-term agent memory
- Memory-aware policies
- Neuro-inspired memory hierarchies
- Autonomous memory curation

---

## 7. One-Line Summary

**Self-supervised learning relies on memory tools for storing and retrieving representations, while reinforcement learning relies on memory frameworks for storing experience trajectories and rewards; modern agents increasingly combine both using external vector memory and agent orchestration frameworks.**

## 8. Exam Tip

> **SSL memory tools learn “what the world looks like,” while RL memory tools learn “what actions work in the world.”**
