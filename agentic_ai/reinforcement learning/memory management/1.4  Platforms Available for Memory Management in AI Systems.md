## 10. One-Line Summary

**Memory management platforms enable AI systems to store, retrieve, and reason over experiences and representations, with vector databases, RL frameworks, and agent orchestration tools forming the backbone of modern intelligent agents.**

---

## 11. Exam Tip

> **Vector databases store “what the agent knows,” while RL replay buffers store “what the agent has experienced.”**
