Course Description

This course introduces students to Prompt Engineering, a critical skill for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI systems. The course covers foundational prompting techniques and advances toward reasoning-based and agentic prompting frameworks, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), and ReAct (Reason + Act). Learners will gain hands-on experience in designing, optimizing, and evaluating prompts for real-world AI applications.

Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:

Explain how LLMs interpret and generate responses from prompts

Introduce structured prompt design techniques

Develop reasoning-based prompting skills for complex problem solving

Enable learners to design agent-style prompts using ReAct

Equip learners with prompt evaluation and optimization strategies
